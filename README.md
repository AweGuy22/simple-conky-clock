# simple-conky-clock
A simple clock and CPU usage / storage monitor for Conky.

# Instructions
1. Install Conky using your distro's package manager.
2. Install the Product Sans font (install all variants!) from this link: https://befonts.com/download/product-sans
3. Run the following command: 
`bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AweGuy22/simple-conky-clock/master/install-from-internet.sh)`.
4. Start Conky.
5. Open ~/.config/conky/conky.conf in a text editor. Edit the values of gap_x and gap_y until you get the perfect position on your desktop. (for me it was 75 and -20)
